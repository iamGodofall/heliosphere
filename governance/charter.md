# Commons Charter (Enforceable v1.0)

## Ownership

- **ISH (Inner Solar Harvester)**: Owned by the **Global Energy Commons Trust (GEC)**  
  – Voting: **1 registered node = 1 vote** (each active MOR or GRN counts as one node)  
  – Decisions require simple majority; constitutional changes require two-thirds supermajority  

- **MOR (Mid-Orbit Relay)**: Owned by **Continental Federations** (e.g., AfriHEC, PanAsiaHEC)  
  – Governance: Delegates elected by GRN operators within the region  
  – Each GRN = 1 delegate vote  

- **GRN (Ground Reception Node)**: Owned by **Municipal Energy Trusts**  
  – Governance: Direct democracy by local residents (age 16+)  
  – No external entity may override local decisions  

> **Note**: All ownership is **inalienable**—nodes cannot be sold, leased, or transferred to private corporations or states.

## Dispute Resolution

All disputes must follow this sequence:

1. **Local Mediation**  
   – Facilitated by a neutral third party from a neighboring trust  
   – Must conclude within **30 days**

2. **Regional DAO Arbitration**  
   – Panel of 3 elected delegates from the relevant Continental Federation  
   – Binding ruling issued within **60 days**  
   – Enforced via technical means (e.g., beam authorization revocation)

3. **UN COPUOS Binding Ruling**  
   – Invoked only if lower tiers fail  
   – Final and binding under **Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty (1967)**  
   – Enforced by signatory states

> **Emergency Exception**: Any registered node may trigger immediate beam deactivation for safety violations, bypassing all tiers.

## Funding

- **No taxes. No user fees. No metering.**  
- **Initial Capital**: Raised through **AAA-rated green bonds** issued by the GEC (2% fixed yield, 30-year term)  
- **Ongoing Operations**: Supported by **voluntary contributions** recorded on a public ledger  
- **Transparency**: All financial flows published in real time on an open, auditable ledger

> **Anti-Enclosure Clause**: Monetization of Heliosphere infrastructure through licensing, tolls, or proprietary control is prohibited. Violation results in automatic node deregistration.
